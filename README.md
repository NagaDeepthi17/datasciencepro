1.Collect the dataset from any of the website. I collected from kaggle.
2.After downloading the dataset mount that dataset into the drive.
3.Open any of the python IDE.
4.I have used google colab, in that open a new notebook and rename that notebook and write code in that.
5.In the left corner of google colab we can see the drive symbol, and we can open the dataset from the drive and choose the select copy path.
6.Paste that selected copy path of a dataset in the code.(for example data=pd.read_csv("../path")
7.And work on the dataset by using python libraries.
